# LevelGenerator

currently finishing to develop

From a png image you will be able to create a level.
Added a window under developer tool to open the plugin settings, you will choose the wall blueprint,the destructible walls and the floor.
Then you will define how the plugin will need to parse your image(i.e which color is wall..)
